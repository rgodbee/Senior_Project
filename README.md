==============
The utilitarian purpose of the “LEGO Minifigure Collector Application” (LMCA) is to provide a convenient 
means of tracking an individual’s collection of LEGO minifigures, and to reference a catalog containing 
all known variants of LEGO minifigures. The social purpose behind this application is for educational use 
with children of elementary age and higher. The wide fan base of LEGO products makes them a useful tool 
for promoting critical thinking, teamwork, and problem solving. LEGO minifigures have an additional 
attribute which is often overlooked by teachers. Minifigures are highly collectible to older children and 
adults. Their monetary value can be used to teach children the concepts of cost, availability, equitable 
trading, and financial responsibilities. The LMCA will provide a medium for in class discussions and 
real-time market evaluations.
